# Cute Animals


## Overview
For project 2, I created a website that allows users to upload pictures of cute animals that they found directly to a site and then view them either randomly or systematially. A user who uploads an animal is then able to sign in and delete or edit the information of the animal they uploaded, but not the information of any animal another user uploaded.
